  # HasFlexColumns is the module that gets included in an ActiveRecord model class as soon as it declares a flex
  # column (using FlexColumns::ActiveRecord::Base#flex_column). While most of the actual work of maintaining and working
  # with a flex column is accomplished by the FlexColumns::Definition::FlexColumnContentsClass module and the
  # FlexColumns::Contents::FlexColumnContentsBase class, there remains, nevertheless, some important work to do here.
