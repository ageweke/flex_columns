    # which defines its instance methods, and FlexColumnContentsClass, which defines its class methods. (While
    # FlexColumnContentsBase is an actual Class, FlexColumnContentsClass is a Module that FlexColumnContentsBase
    # +extend+s. Both could be combined, but, simply for readability and maintainability, it was better to make them
    # separate.)

    # the block passed to +flex_column+, for example.
